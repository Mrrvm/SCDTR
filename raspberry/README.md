# Raspberry Pi hosted C++ server

To run the server, simply upload the `main/` content to a raspberry pi and run the command

```
sh startup.sh
```

If you want it to start autonomously, you can add it to `rc.local`. Check this [guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md).
